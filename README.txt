This is the Linear Search code.
The time complexity of the provided linear search algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
In the worst-case scenario, the element being searched for is not present in the array, and the algorithm has to iterate through all elements of the array.

For the best-case scenario, where the element being searched for is found at the very beginning of the array, the time complexity would be O(1), constant time. This is because the algorithm would find the element after just one comparison.
